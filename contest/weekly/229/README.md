## The Day of The Contest
I only solved the first two questions, browsed thru the description of Q3 and Q4, choosing to focus on Q3 but failed to devise a solution before running out of time.

In the same day, I kind of accused myself of not being able to solve Q3 despite of having spending time pondering upon it.
So I watched a few videos on dynamic programming, hoping to get some insight; in the afternoon, I seemingly got one idea to solve Q3 using recursion with
memoization; however, leetcode's website told me that I only passed somewhere btw 29/59 cases, failing because of too long running time. Maybe I should
convert the solution to bottom-up DP? I wasn't quite sure.
