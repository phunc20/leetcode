`aa_dp1.py` and `ab_dp0.py` resembles a lot, differing only at that
- `aa_dp1.py` always assumes (reasonable) the input `S`'s 0-th element being `"("`
- `ab_dp0.py` does not make that assumption

## Submission Syntax
The file `submission/aa_dp1.py` contains the accepted code. It looks pretty weird and that's because the
solution is required to be a class and I spent some extra time, even having implemented my solution, to
find one right syntax which can be accepted by leetcode.
