## I failed to finish this question during the contest
But after the contest, I spent a few hours trying to solve it on my own.
- The following files are the effort. They are a bit messy, because I kind of tried to solve the problem by trial and error, without enough analyzing possible cases. Finally, `ae_split_cases.py` seems to be accepted as a solution.
  ```
  aa_find_all_sums.py
  ab_reduce_left_right.py
  ac_reduce_left_right.py
  ad_both_ends.py
  ae_split_cases.py
  cases.py
  ```
- `aa_find_all_sums.py` takes too long to find `cases[2]` in `cases.py`

## Todos
01. If you have time, try to estimate the time complexity of `aa_find_all_sums.py` and `ab` through `ae`.
02. There are hints on this question and the following are links I found on the Internet:
